# Breast Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project implements various supervised learning algorithms to classify breast cancer using the sklearn dataset.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

## Steps
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Model training using multiple classifiers:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Model evaluation and comparison

## Dependencies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
Run the Python script to train models and evaluate performance.

## Results
The best-performing model is identified based on accuracy.
